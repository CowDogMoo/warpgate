Warp Gate facilitates the creation of docker images using Packer and
provided forms of provisioning logic, such as Ansible. This allows
for the creation of container images without having to write a
`Dockerfile`. Instead, you can simply use the same code that
you would to provision a VM.

An image is represented as a blueprint, which Warp Gate consumes
to create it.

Feel free to peruse existing `blueprints/` and modify one to fit
your needs.
